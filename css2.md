# Colors in CSS
Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
# How to specify a color in CSS?
There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
 1. RGB values: Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
 2. Hex Codes: Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
 3. HSL colors: stands for Hue, Saturation and Brightness.
 4. Color Names: Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
 
 ## Opacity
 CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0.

The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity.
