## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You can format words as bold or italic, add images, and create and many other customizations. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like #, *.

## Markdown Guide:
1. Headers: To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
2. Italic: to write in italic write your text between two star symbols. eg: * your text here * (without spaces).
3. Bold: to write in bold write your text between four star symbols. eg: ** your text here ** (without spaces).
4. Strikethrough: to strikethrough text write your text between four tilde symbols. eg: ~~ your text here ~~ (without spaces).
5. Links: You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).
