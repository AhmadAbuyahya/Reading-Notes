Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files,
Its main purpose is coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development.
This helps accomplish everything faster and achieves data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.


GitHub is a hosting service for software development and version control using Git.

The main commands used in git are the three A-C-P commands which are:
* git add filename
* git commit -m "message"
* git push

There is also the clone command that is used to copy code to the terminal from a repo URL.
* git clone repolink

To get the changes made elsewhere on our files we use:
* git pull
