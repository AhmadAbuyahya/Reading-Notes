## chapter 1: Structure
* HTML uses **tags** (characters between angled
brackets) to give meaning to the information they surround.
* **Tags** are often referred to as elements.
* There are opening and closing **tags**. The opening **tags** denote
the start of content; the closing **tags** denote the end.
* Opening **tags** can carry *attributes*, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* *Attributes* require a name and a value.

## Chapter 18: Process & Design
* A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. 
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

## Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout
* HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
* These elements provide clearer code.
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

## Chapter 8: Extra Markup
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
